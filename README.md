# Bellabeat-Case-Study

This repository contains my analysis for one of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Projects on Coursera. The goal of this analysis  is to use fitness data to provide insights to the stakeholders at 'Bellabeat', a health-focused smart tech company, into how customers are using their products that will help guide marketing strategy for the company.

The data in this repository was cleaned and analyzed using RStudio, the data visualizations were created using Tableau, and the final presentation was created using powerpoint.
